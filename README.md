Stars! in Windows 3.1 in DOSBox

**Note:** If you want more seamless integration with Windows, try [starswine](https://github.com/stars-4x/starswine).

Notes and issues:
* Good practice is to save files to the D: drive.  Files are found
  outside of DOSBox in the d_drive sub-folder.

* DOSBox is set to capture the mouse.  Press CTRL + F10 to toggle
  release.

* Running DOSBox on Windows 10 inside a VM or remote connection may 
  mess up the mouse acceleration.  There is no known workaround for 
  this yet.  If you find something please share.

* To change Windows 3.1 resolution, exit Stars! and open 'Windows
  Setup'.  Select 'Options' -> 'Change System Settings...' and 
  choose a new display driver.  Best resolutions are:
  
   - Start with 'S3' (S3 HW driver)
   - End with 'SF' (small font)
   - Have 256 colors (least memory, all colors of Stars!)
  
  Once selected, choose to use 'Current' driver, and restart 
  Windows.
