Stars! in Windows 3.1 in DOSBox

Notes and issues:
* Good practice is to save files to the D: drive.  Files are found
  outside of DOSBox in the d_drive sub-folder.

* DOSBox is set to capture the mouse.  Press CTRL + F10 to toggle
  release.

* Running DOSBox on Windows 10 inside a VM or remote connection may 
  mess up the mouse acceleration.  There is no known workaround for 
  this yet.  If you find something please share.
